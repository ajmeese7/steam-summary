A Steam profile visualizer.

I looked around for a while for a good Steam profile visualizer but I could never
find one that was up to my standards, so I made this.

### Setup
Make a file called `apikey.js` and paste in the following information:
```
var apikey = {
  key : "YOUR_KEY_HERE"
}
```

Of course, replace the API key with your own, which you can get [here](http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).
